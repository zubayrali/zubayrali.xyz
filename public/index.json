Effort into experimenting with different things till you find that one thing that just clicks, or if nothing clicks, you should go with what you’ve put most hours into and enjoy doing the most.\nFresh out of high school, I had decided I didn’t want to get an engineering degree after learning the harrowing tales of engineering students in India. Instead, I wanted to provide myself with skills and rely on them to break into IT.\nMy experiments with finding that “one” thing ended after a few years of back \u0026amp; forth…until then I was just really trying to do the best I could with whatever guidance I got (none whatsoever).\nI really do think that it is a privilege to be able to “find” or build your passion, not something everybody is able to afford. But my days have led me to this sad truth that not enough people value passion or appreciate it, or spend the energy themselves to find it.\nAs a student myself, I’ve known many other students from various fields. The vast majority of them chose their Bachelors out of no particular reason, nor did they have the intentions of carving a path out of it.\n“It just happened to be the college I could afford.” “I don’t know, it sounds it has something to do with computers, maybe I’ll take up a few courses to build my skills.” (Never did) “Closest to my house, attendance is not mandatory.” “Will use it to apply for Masters in the USA.” “My father is a Civil engineer, he wants me to be one as well.” All of this to set the context for why I chose not to do a Masters overseas, while it became everybody else’s move right after graduating.\nMaster’s Degree just for the sake of it #\rIn a statement released on Thursday, the US Mission in India has said that it has issued a record-breaking 82,000 student visas to Indians in 2022 to date. Indian students have received more US student visas than any other country, including China.\nAmong these 82k people, I\u0026rsquo;ve known at least 10 people who flew to the USA this year…that isn\u0026rsquo;t a very big data set (statistically speaking) for me to forge these opinions, but I’ll do it anyway.\nA lot of people that I know who have chosen to do a Masters, usually do little to no research in the program they choose. They completed their Bachelors and are simply unable to find appealing employment opportunities here, so they do the next best thing. A Masters somewhere overseas like Australia, UK, Canada, USA. Some take into account their shot at securing a PR (Permanent Resident), others look for what country has the best money-making policies for students (like hours of work, $s per hour) etc.\nTo start your process of flying overseas for your Master’s degree, you will approach a consultancy. Some of them do charge a fee for their services, which include, applying to universities, writing your SOP for you, coaxing you into doing your Masters at a particular university in a particular program (incentivized by universities), fake the funds in your bank account that you’re supposed to disclose during your visa filing etcetera, etcetera.\nMy consultancy advised me that I take a course at a reputed University (high fees) so I don’t get flagged by the visa authorities and that I can “switch” to a more affordable university after I land there. I was also informed that I could make decent money working odd jobs to pay for the hefty college fees I was about to pay. Some take out loans, others are supported by their parents.\nI am not trying to take a shit on these consultancies, a million dollar businesses; they’re providing valuable services. Nor am I saying that people shouldn’t do it, if they can find better employment opportunities and living standards elsewhere, they should go for it. But it does make me quite suspicious about the whole academic system. All of it just seems too methodical.\nI’ve personally known guys who were passionate about pursuing something before they flew off for their Master’s. It landed them in blue collar (unskilled) jobs that made them decent money (money they’d make in India in a skilled profession). Naturally, they lost interest in that thing they were excited about. Now, their plan is to make as much money as possible doing those menial jobs before they’re deported (there are contingency plans to avoid this) or if they get lucky a PR is handed to them. I know this is totally fine, they can come back home to set up businesses or whatever.\nSee: How recruiters in India use false promises to lure students to Canada - The Fifth Estate - YouTube\nWhat I find most disconcerting, however, is the loss of Identity Capital.\nIdentity Capital #\rIn her book, The Defining Decade; Meg Jay describes Identity Capital as:\nIdentity capital is our collection of personal assets. It is the repertoire of individual resources that we assemble over time. These are the investments we make in ourselves, the things we do well enough, or long enough, that they become a part of who we are. Some identity capital goes on a résumé, such as degrees, jobs, test scores, and clubs. Other identity capital is more personal, such as how we speak, where we are from, how we solve problems, how we look. Identity capital is how we build ourselves—bit by bit, over time. Most important, identity capital is what we bring to the adult marketplace. It is the currency we use to metaphorically purchase jobs and relationships and other things we want.\nI hope I am not too bold in assuming that folks who follow this “path” that a thousand others are also on are hardly building discernible Identity Capital.\nIt takes years for people to really figure out what they want to do in their lives, for the fortunate few who do identify where their passion lies, why should they be underemployed for 2 crucial years of their twenties doing something that was part of their ticket to the USA? I am not taking a shit on blue collar jobs, all kinds of labors deserve dignity.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t even have that much faith in the Academic system. A lot of the times, a degree is just reduced to be just another criteria in a job description.\nChoose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.\n— variously attributed1\nUltimately, it’s not about what makes you the most money, but going on your path doing what you love. Most people spend a significant amount of time trying to find what their calling is, but those who have already figured it out, money should be the least of your worries. Granted that not having to worry about money is also a privilege not everybody has.\nWhile the tone and mood of this article may come across as disgruntled, my sincere intention is to emphasize how the current state of the education system has stifled individuality. Ideally, we should have more people pursuing careers in science or other fields that truly interest them. However, we have inadvertently fostered a culture of shortcuts, which has extinguished countless passions in pursuit of material success. This widely followed \u0026ldquo;template\u0026rdquo; has dismantled childhood dreams and thrust people into a relentless rat race.\nIn conclusion, this saying was anonymous in the earliest citation in 1982 located by QI. The linkage to Confucius appears to be spurious.

I deactivated my Facebook account in 2017, mostly because it became \u0026ldquo;uncool\u0026rdquo; and my generation was moving on to Instagram.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve always had this creeping feeling that somehow we\u0026rsquo;re being manipulated by these platforms; that they\u0026rsquo;re messing with our individuality.\nIf you are ever tempted to look for outside approval, realize that you have compromised your integrity. If you need a witness, be your own.\nEpictetus\nIn 2018, everybody was going on these \u0026ldquo;shoots\u0026rdquo;, to take pictures for their feeds. Going out was not just something people did for fun, but they had a clear agenda of taking \u0026ldquo;Instagrammable\u0026rdquo; pictures, fake candid(“plandids”). You went home and start editing those pictures, I\u0026rsquo;ve known guys who\u0026rsquo;d face tune their facial features to look more \u0026ldquo;Instaworthy\u0026rdquo; and search for captions on Google and slap it on whether it was relevant to the picture or not as long as it sounded \u0026ldquo;cool\u0026rdquo;.\nAll of this to project some kind of personality/image. Some uniqueness among the hundred others who were doing literally the same thing. In the search for uniqueness, they lost their individuality.\nAnd as soon as you press \u0026ldquo;Upload\u0026rdquo;, you stare at those notifications, keep dragging it down to refresh to check if you\u0026rsquo;ve received any likes/comments. Like some mindless robot driven by cheap dopamine hits from validation.\nConstantly being “ranked” by your peers, wouldn’t everyone want to win at these “games of validation” ? Even if your life is in fact splendid, you’d not feel good enough unless others say so.\nWhat the hell are Snapchat streaks, and why do people do it?\nI never got around to using Snapchat, I did make an account on it once, but it just seemed weird how people were living for the \u0026ldquo;snaps\u0026rdquo;, no matter how mundane and insignificant a moment, you\u0026rsquo;ve got to snap it - wait, first, you\u0026rsquo;ve to choose the \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; filter for it. Who likes to post something as they SEE AND EXPERIENCE it when you can distort and change it with filters…you\u0026rsquo;re an artist after all, a photographer who really cares about color grading their pictures, you need them to look good on your prints that you\u0026rsquo;re going to sell to people passionate about art…oh wait it only lasts for 24 hours.\nAnd when Instagram shamelessly stole Snapchat\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;feature\u0026rdquo;, Instagram stories is where it was at. With even more filters to filter your sad life through. Who cares about acceptance of oneself and how they look when they can gaslight themselves with filters, I remember dudes who used the flower tiara filter.\nEverything these days is \u0026ldquo;content\u0026rdquo; - the word feels so disgusting to me. The fake models of the social media did not just happen. It was cultivated by manipulative \u0026ldquo;features\u0026rdquo;. The likes, the views, the following/followers ratio. The validation.\nHumans want to feel validated, they want to belong.\nAll of this to say that - this shit caused a lot of anxiety for my already struggling, insecure self. I am guilty of doing some of these cringy trends, but when I finally realized how I was being manipulated and how I am just better off not using any of these apps, I stopped. Receiving likes from people doesn’t actually mean people like you, they’re simply giving you validation as a favor which you’ll return by liking one of their pictures. I deleted my accounts, and I\u0026rsquo;ve never been more confident with myself. From fooling oneself to actually putting in time and effort in reconciling with your issues and practicing self-love.\nConsoomers #\rThe biggest threat to your focus is cheap dopamine.\nPeople find it hard to spend time with themselves, they need their \u0026ldquo;Cocaine Pellet Dispenser\u0026rdquo; to keep them constantly entertained. I\u0026rsquo;ve known guys who don\u0026rsquo;t eat their lunches without first putting on something on YouTube, or they\u0026rsquo;ve food in their right hand and their device in their left hand to scroll IG Reels.\nWe all have been guilty of religiously checking our phones the first thing after we wake up. Is this what we want our morning rituals to look like? Is it really going to promote a productive/healthy lifestyle?\nOur attention spans have dropped significantly, I can’t read a book for 30 mins straight without wanting to go for my phone for a quick peek. For that quick dopamine hit.\nOur lives are occupied by these devices that cause us so much distraction — I have turned off notifications for most of the apps I use. I cannot afford to lose any attention over the brand-new deal you’ve Amazon or Myntra.\nDo you ever feel this urge to go for your phone as soon as it vibrates or rings (I usually keep my phone on vibrate mode), it’s like it’s exactly like some Pavlovian response, we’ve been thoroughly conditioned by our smartphones, almost as if we’ve no free will left? Are we just some mindless monkeys?\nDoom scrolling\nControlled by algorithms that dictate what we consume next. Social media offers bite-sized content that is easily digestible, simply scroll away if you’re not amused enough by a post. There\u0026rsquo;s only an infinite amount of scrolling to be done.\nWhy would anyone want to waste their time like this instead of doing something productive like reading books, articles or actually going out to “socialize”.\nEven when you go out to catch up socially with your friends, it isn’t a rare sight that your mates act like scroll zombies. Wasn’t socializing supposed to be fun? How can we allow getting bored with each other so much that we’d rather watch a glass brick.\nLouise : So what happened, were you bored in Manchester?\nJohnny : Was I bored? No, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t fuckin\u0026rsquo; bored. I\u0026rsquo;m never bored. That\u0026rsquo;s the trouble with everybody - you\u0026rsquo;re all so bored. You\u0026rsquo;ve had nature explained to you and you\u0026rsquo;re bored with it, you\u0026rsquo;ve had the living body explained to you and you\u0026rsquo;re bored with it, you\u0026rsquo;ve had the universe explained to you and you\u0026rsquo;re bored with it. So now you want cheap thrills and like plenty of them, and it don\u0026rsquo;t matter how tawdry or vacuous they are as long as it\u0026rsquo;s new, as long as it\u0026rsquo;s new, as long as it flashes and fuckin\u0026rsquo; bleeps in forty fuckin\u0026rsquo; different colors. So whatever else you can say about me, I\u0026rsquo;m not fuckin\u0026rsquo; bored.\n— Naked (1993) - David Thewlis as Johnny\nI firmly believe in Unix philosophy on software:\nMake each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new \u0026ldquo;features\u0026rdquo;.\n— via Unix philosophy - Wikipedia\nEvery software wants to be like every other software. Twitter is soon going to have \u0026ldquo;blogging\u0026rdquo; functionality for long-form content(there\u0026rsquo;s that dumb word again). Whatever happened to Twitter Fleets?\nSubsequently, WhatsApp also introduced WhatsApp status…like they hadn\u0026rsquo;t already hooked their users on Facebook and Instagram. People now have to regularly update/check their WhatsApp statuses. All of these apps rely on the model of \u0026ldquo;making users spend as much time on the app as possible\u0026rdquo;. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if this isn\u0026rsquo;t a threat to our attention, then what is?\nUnrealistic Expectations #\rSocial media is creating misguided expectations among people in all aspects of life. The perfect vacation, the perfect wedding, the perfect skin, the perfect body, the perfect partner. It’s all about #goals.\nWe watch as other people live our goals. What do you think it’s doing to our psyche? Is it not contributing to anxiety and FOMO(fear of missing out)? While it is doing nothing for you to bring closer to your #goals. Why do anything about my mediocre life when I can watch the most significant moment of other’s lives in a desperate attempt into escapism?\nI am not asking you to be content with whatever you’ve, that is your problem and you’ll figure it out but at least take out the leech that’s sucking off your happiness. From FOMO to JOMO (joy of missing out).\nYou’re not doing anything to free those who are more trapped. You’re only enslaving them more by entrenching the system.\nPractice stoicism. Be Zen. You can’t do it if you’re constantly being reminded of how fun and exciting everyone else’s life is.\nSimping\nI’ve a problem with men who follow women on IG for their “personality”. We all know they do it for their “assets” …why do these men fall so low? I get it, sometimes you need to appreciate the beauty, but I know guys whose feeds exclusively contain pictures/reels of half naked women. Don’t even get me started on these “simps” who say they follow them for their “content”, I am not saying women are unfunny, but most of these women are trying to capitalize on their looks.\nThis type of soft-core porn is just as potent as the regular porn. From actual masturbation to mental masturbation about being with these women. It is unhealthy for you to continue doing this, as it creates a twisted sense of expectations from your (potential) partners.\nThe standards of beauty, love, sex and lifestyle that social media/internet portrays is undeniably detached from reality.\nNote: I am not using the term “simp” in a toxic masculinity way. Women should be respected regardless of their looks.\nAds \u0026amp; Free Will #\rIf something is free, you’re the product.\n— variously attributed1\nYouTube now shows at least 2 ads before playing a video. IG shows 1 ad after every 2 stories(?). It’s weird how people tolerate being made to watch ads. You can’t use third party clients:\nCease and Desist of Facebook and Instagram - Barinsta Death of Vanced Youtube Casper, the best alternative to Snapchat, is no longer available These companies claim that they don’t allow third-party apps because of privacy risks, but it\u0026rsquo;s usually bullshit because third-party apps come with adblockers and these companies lose money over them.\nYou do one Google search about anything and ads for those products are shoved at you from all directions because all of them sell your data for the most targeted advertising possible.\nThe ads might be useful for the discovery of the product, but most of the time, they’re modifying your behavior. Almost to the extent that they’re taking away your free will to make decisions on your own. The more ads you watch, the more money you’re likely to spend.\nImpulse buying\nInfluencers and graphic designers make flashy ads, peddling the hell out of a thing and before you know it, they’ve influenced you into buying it. Go ahead, order that thing that you think will help you fill the void in your life, after all, an influencer vouched that it was “life-changing”.\nWhen you watch fewer ads, you’re not exposed to the million products out there and spend less money. When you actually need something in your life, you’ll go out looking for it, or somebody you personally know will introduce you to it. You don’t really need social media for the discovery of these products.\nEcho chambers\nYou’re only fed the kind of content that you resonate with, you hardly get to listen to the argument from by people on the other side of the fence. Furthermore, you live in a bubble that keeps fortifying whatever you believe in. This is called confirmation bias, filtering information through our preexisting beliefs and opinions.\nSocial media is so tailored, your feed will hardly ever have an opposing/differing viewpoint. We don’t need algorithm governed feeds, we need dumb (mostly unfiltered) feeds to have a better, more nuanced, grounded in truth (not half-truths) understanding of the differing voices in these highly political times.\nTake Back Control #\rNow, I understand that you cannot completely go off the grid. Social media \u0026amp; internet has become part and parcel of our lives.\nHere are something I do to reduce distractions, eliminate ads.\nWhen you know better, you’ve an obligation towards yourself to do better.\nFor Browser\nI use Brave Browser, it has an inbuilt adblocker that does a very good job across many websites. uBlock Origin is another good option for browser-wide adblocking.\nUse Onetab to reduce tab clutter.\nIf you’re looking for network-wide adblocking, I’ll recommend Pi-hole.\nFor YouTube, I use SponsorBlock and Unhook to hide UI elements that I find distracting.\nFor LinkedIn, I use LinkOff that “Cleans the LinkedIn feed based on keywords and filters”. I keep LinkedIn feed completely hidden, as it\u0026rsquo;s just the most soul-eating platform on the planet. Sadly, I do have to use it for discovering career opportunities.\nFor Twitter, I use minimal-twitter which is an extension to block certain UI elements of the Twitter website. Also checkout nitter.it\nI use Unclutter when reading articles on the web, it declutters the UI of a web page for better readability. Bonus: Jiffy Reader adds Bionic Reading to articles for speed reading for free!\nFor Android\nminimalist phone is a launcher that reduces distractions with a minimal layout and app drawer.\nFor YouTube checkout, NewPipe - a free YouTube client. And ReVanced which is a revival project of Vanced YouTube.\nI also use Gray-Switch that turns the entire screen grayscale, making it less appealing to reach for. Another amazing option is DetoxDroid.\nResources #\rReframing the “Social Media” Problem As an Attention Crisis | by Peter Wang | Medium -Social-Media-Observatory wiki The Social Dilemma Ten Arguments For Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now by Jaron Lanier Get Off the Cocaine Pellet Dispenser: Amusing Ourselves to Death by Neil Postman - Made You Think Podcast Phantom vibration syndrome - Wikipedia Grumpy Website dumber phone - nomasters nonparticipation - nomasters Reasons not to use (i.e., be used by) Facebook The Web Is Fucked Can Technology Value Reflection over Engagement? — Minimalist EdTech Why I\u0026rsquo;m sick of technology — blog.mjb.im Surveillance Capitalism I: How digital platforms watch, track \u0026amp; control you This blog post was supposed to be about why I don’t use social media, but it seems like I’ve successfully managed to made it into a rant about the internet, software and people.\nThanks for reading!\nIn conclusion, this saying evolved over time.

#\rThe question is not, Can they reason?, nor Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?\nJeremy Bentham\nEvery hour in India 1.1 Million animals are slaughtered.\nImagine being bred artificially and then fed till you can\u0026rsquo;t stand straight, kept in the most disgusting facilities only to be slaughtered for a Human to enjoy a few seconds of mouth pleasure.\nWhat do we have in common with these animals?\nThe ability to feel pain.\nWhy can\u0026rsquo;t we acknowledge the fact that these animals are emotional just like us, have a preference of living over death and have a desire of well being over pain.\nLets take the example of milk production.\nMost of the cows are artifically inseminated by the semen they collect from the bulls by either Electroejaculation.\nA man puts his hand inside the anus of the cow and the semen is literally shot inside the uterus of the cow using a \u0026ldquo;Gun\u0026rdquo; - How is this not considered rape?\nThe cow is then forced to endure the pain of carrying a calf inside her for months and then when she finally delivers the calf, the calf is taken away from the mother, the milk that she lactated for her kid is made into various dairy products while the calf is sold to butchers where its fed artificial milk formula.\nThis cycle goes on for multiple times in the cow\u0026rsquo;s life until she is old and will no longer bear any kids and then its sold for slaughter…one last sacrifice forced on her for humans to consume her meat and use its skin as leather.\nNow try to answer.\nIs this suffering of a conscious, thinking, feeling, animal worth that glass of milk?\nThe details are as gruesome as this or more for other animals like factory farmed chickens.\nThe chicken is selectively bred to grow large, so large that their other organs can\u0026rsquo;t keep up leading to diseases and deformities, the ones that do survive are killed at just 42 days old, worldwide about 137 million chicken are killed everyday.\nWould you mind being born a chicken?\nThere are many horrors of this industry.\nLike how these male chickens are put inside a shredder alive and made as animal food because they can\u0026rsquo;t lay eggs. watch\nDon\u0026rsquo;t even get me started on how unfathomably cruely pigs are gassed to death.\nIs this suffering worth a few moments of pleasure to our taste buds? I think not.\nAll this death, cries and suffering can be avoided by just turning to a plant based diet.\nBeyond The Suffering #\rThis industry is also detrimental for our planet.\nWe have 12 billion acres of agricultural land in the World, 68% of it is used for livestock.\nForests are cleared for making grazing land/cattle ranches, leading to deforestation, land conversion, loss of biodiversity.\nThis industry uses an enormous amount of water. Water is used to grow crops for animals to eat, clean their enclosures and give animals water to drink. But the industry also creates organic and inorganic pollutants.\nCows leave a large carbon footprint, a cow releases between 70 and 120 kg of Methane per year, the release of about 100 kg Methane per year for each cow is equivalent to about 2’300 kg CO2 per year.
